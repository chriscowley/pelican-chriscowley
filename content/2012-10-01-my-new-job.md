I have now got new challenges and am designing much bigger systems. Whereas before I would have take one of these:
{% img center /images/p2000-g3-sff.png 250 400 %}
<!-- more -->
Plugged it into a pair of these:
{% img center /images/silkworm.jpg 250 450 %}
And finally plugged in a pair of these:
{% img center /images/dl380g7.jpg 200 400 %}

Now I do not actually do the plugging in - that is not part of the documented process. Also, the system I am designing is on the other side of the world. However I now take one of <a href="http://uk.emc.com/storage/symmetrix-vmax/vmax-20k.htm" target="_blank">these</a>, a couple of <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/ps4159/ps4358/ps5395/index.html" target="_blank">these</a> and add a couple of racks of <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps10265/index.html" target="_blank">these</a>. Finally it all plugs into a couple of <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps10098/index.html" target="_blank">these</a>.

True I am not as hand-ons as I would like to be (for now). However, I am getting exposed to a the real big boys kit with systems that are used by 100k+ users, as opposed to 100 users. The challenge is very real, but exciting. As we quite often said at Snell:

"Challenge accepted..."
