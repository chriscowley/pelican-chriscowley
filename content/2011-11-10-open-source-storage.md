I have searchstorage.co.uk send me potentially interesting white-papers regularly. If I am honest, most of them or thinly veiled press-releases. However occasionally one is interesting.

Today I received one entitled <a href="{{ root_url }}/downloads/ITinEU_Storage_autumn11_final.pdf">Break free of vendor lock-in with open source storage</a>. Being a FLOSS fan and a storage specialist, that obviously intrigued me.
<!-- more -->

The article of interest starts on page 8 and is pretty good. It mentions all the main players; unusually it is not condescending towards Open Source (i.e. it will get you by until you can afford to buy a proper/stupidly-over-priced solution).

It also mentions <a href="https://www.gluster.org" target="_blank">GlusterFS</a>, which is particularly interesting. I have just built a solution at work built around this and it excellent. I will be putting more info up soon as a complete how-to on building a full-featured, high availability SAN/NAS.
