Install Skype â€“ I used <a href="http://slayachronicles.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/installing-skype-on-fedora-16-64-bit.html" target="_blank" >these</a> instructions. This will seem to get everything working, but video will just give you a black screen and no error message. This is because Skype is 32 bit and your webcam driver is 64 bit. Make sure you have libv4l.i686 installed along with a couple of other dependencies:
<!-- more -->

```
sudo yum install libv4l.i686 alsa-lib.i686 libXv.i686 libXScrnSaver.i686 \
    qt.i686 qt-x11.i686    
```

Now create a wrapper script to launch it with a custom environment. I put it in _/usr/local/bin/skype_

{% include_code lang:bash skype %}

This will now get loaded before the main Skype executable and you will have a working video device.
