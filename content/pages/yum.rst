I run a yum repository for a few packages that are not available and/or
too old in the standard Enterprise Linux repositories.

-  CentOS 6:
   `SRPMS <http://yum.chriscowley.me.uk/el/6/SRPMS/repoview/>`__
   `i686 <http://yum.chriscowley.me.uk/el/6/i686/repoview/>`__
   `x86\_64 <http://yum.chriscowley.me.uk/el/6/x86_64/repoview/>`__
-  CentOS 7:
   `SRPMS <http://yum.chriscowley.me.uk/el/7/SRPMS/repoview/>`__
   `x86\_64 <http://yum.chriscowley.me.uk/el/7/x86_64/repoview/>`__
-  Fedora Rawhide:
   `SRPMS <http://yum.chriscowley.me.uk/test/fedora/rawhide/source/repoview/>`__
   `x86\_64 <http://yum.chriscowley.me.uk/test/fedora/rawhide/x86_64/repoview/>`__

`GPG Key <http://yum.chriscowley.me.uk/RPM-GPG-KEY-ChrisCowley>`__

**WARNING:** I am not giving instructions on how to enable for a simple
reason. The stuff in there is experimental; as such if you do not know
how to enable it from this information it is probably best that you
leave it alone. If you do, then good luck :)
