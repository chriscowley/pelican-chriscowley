My new job

:tags:  france

I have now got new challenges and am designing much bigger systems.
Whereas before I would have take one of these: {% img center
/images/p2000-g3-sff.png 250 400 %} Plugged it into a pair of these: {%
img center /images/silkworm.jpg 250 450 %} And finally plugged in a pair
of these: {% img center /images/dl380g7.jpg 200 400 %}

Now I do not actually do the plugging in - that is not part of the
documented process. Also, the system I am designing is on the other side
of the world. However I now take one of these, a couple of these and add
a couple of racks of these. Finally it all plugs into a couple of these.

True I am not as hand-ons as I would like to be (for now). However, I am
getting exposed to a the real big boys kit with systems that are used by
100k+ users, as opposed to 100 users. The challenge is very real, but
exciting. As we quite often said at Snell:

"Challenge accepted..."
