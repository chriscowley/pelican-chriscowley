Open Source Storage

:tags:  storage

I have searchstorage.co.uk send me potentially interesting white-papers
regularly. If I am honest, most of them or thinly veiled press-releases.
However occasionally one is interesting.

Today I received one entitled Break free of vendor lock-in with open
source storage. Being a FLOSS fan and a storage specialist, that
obviously intrigued me.

The article of interest starts on page 8 and is pretty good. It mentions
all the main players; unusually it is not condescending towards Open
Source (i.e. it will get you by until you can afford to buy a
proper/stupidly-over-priced solution).

It also mentions GlusterFS, which is particularly interesting. I have
just built a solution at work built around this and it excellent. I will
be putting more info up soon as a complete how-to on building a
full-featured, high availability SAN/NAS.
