I have been a Sys Admin for quite a while now. Specialising in Linux means that I am often called upon to be a “jack of all trades, master of many”. In the last week I have touched upon storage, multiple programming languages (Bash, PHP, Python, Ruby and Java), Linux, Exchange, Tomcat, Virtualization and Systems architecture. I am sure the list could go on … and on … and on …
<!-- more -->

There is however something that I feel I am missing. Before I was in my current post, I was more of a developer. I did a lot of Shell scripting, but also ADA and C/C++. Nowadays I do not do that, which is a shame. Virtually all modern programming languages trace their roots back to C and C++. The whole of Linux/UNIX traces its roots back to C. Our world is built on C/C++!

This is something I have neglected over recent years, so I’m going to change that. A bit of Google-fu just now has bought me some interesting resources:

    <a href="http://www.howtoforge.com/howtos/programming/c-cplusplus" target="_blank" >http://www.howtoforge.com/howtos/programming/c-cplusplus</a>
    <a href="http://www.gtk.org/tutorial1.2/" target="_blank" >http://www.gtk.org/tutorial1.2/</a>
    <a href="http://zetcode.com/tutorials/qt4tutorial/" target="_blank" >http://zetcode.com/tutorials/qt4tutorial/</a>

I have not looked at any of these in detail yet, but I will be over the next few days. At the end I hope to have dragged this hard-earned knowledge kicking and screaming from the back of my mind.
