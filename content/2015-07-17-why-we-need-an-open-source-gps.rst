:summary: Currently all the major exercise GPS units are proprietory. I think we need an open alternative.

The GPS market is really dominated by Garmin, for the simple reason that that the make an excellent product.
However, I really think we need to have an alternative device that is totally open source. Why? Because not only do these things follow us everywhere, but they broadcast that information everywhere too.
