{% img right https://www.android.com/images/whatsnew/jb-new-logo.png  %}This was weird! I just updated my venerable ZTE Blade to Cyanogenmod 10.1 (Jellybean). I flashed it, then rebooted having completely forgotten to to install GApps. No problem, reboot into Clockmod Recovery and install them. Promlem: no option to reboot to recovery.

It turns out that you need to enable *Advanced reboot* in the *Developer Options. Problem where are those options. In Jellybean 4.2 they are hidden.

- Open up *Settings* -> *About Phone*
- Find the entry for *Build number*
- Tap on it 7 times (honest), after the 3rd it will start to count down.

Now you will have a new option under *Settings* for *Developer Options* in which you can turn on *Advanced Reboot"

For anyone who has a ZTE Blade and would like to get the latest and greatest Android on it, the files are [here](https://copy.com/Dqx4qRjgs6KK).
